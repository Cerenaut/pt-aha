  """Create a sequences of length equal to seq_length. Pairs are formed with digits from 0 to the number specified
   by characters. From Schapiro: There were eight items (Aâ€“H) grouped into four pairs (AB, CD, EF, GH). Items within a
    pair always occurred in a fixed order but the sequence of pairs was random. Specifically, the second item in a pair
    could transition to the first item in one of the three other pairs. Back-to-back repetitions of a pair were excluded,
    since this is a common constraint in statistical learning experiments and because allowing repetitions would dilute
    the temporal asymmetry (both AB and BA would be exposed). There was a moving window of two stimuli presented at
    a time. After AB, for example, BC, BE, or BG followed with equal probability; if BC was chosen, the next input would
be CD. """
